# Pico-W Dual Serial 

This is a simple board that supports two RS-232 serial ports (TXD & RXD _only_) with a
Raspberry PI Pico-W.  This is useful to internet-enable devices that support a serial 
interface.

This board is sized for a [Hammond Manufacturing 1591XXSFLBK](https://www.hammfg.com/part/1591XXSFLBK) enclosure.
